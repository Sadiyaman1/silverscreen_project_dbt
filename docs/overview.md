## Silverscreen Project

The **Silverscreen Project** explores movie performance across several cinema locations in New Jersey.  
It focuses on understanding how ticket sales, rental costs, and total revenue interact to determine the profitability of each film.  

This project was created as part of a learning journey to become familiar with **dbt (data build tool)** and its core concepts. It demonstrates how raw data can be cleaned, structured, and transformed into meaningful insights through clear data models and automated testing.  

By analyzing performance at different cinema locations, the project highlights how data-driven decision-making can support better business strategies in the entertainment industry.  
The results show how consistent data modeling and validation can help ensure accuracy, transparency, and reliability across all reporting layers.
